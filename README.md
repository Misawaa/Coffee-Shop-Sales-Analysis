### Project Overview 

This project explores real-world coffee shop sales data using Microsoft Excel to uncover key insights into sales performance, profitability, seasonal demand, and location-based trends.
The goal was to turn raw data into actionable business insights that help optimize store operations and improve overall revenue.

### Data Sources

Coffee Shop Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "coffee_shop_sales.xlsx file" containing transaction records for multiple coffee shop locations, including product category location data.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  - Data Cleaning & Transformation
  - Pivot Tables & Charts
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Dashboard Design

- Data Visualization & Analysis
  - Sales Trend Analysis
  - Location Performance Comparison
  - Profitability Insights
  - Seasonal Demand Tracking


### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Reviewed raw dataset to understand structure, column formats, and missing values.
2. Handled missing and inconsistent data by correcting blanks and standardizing product and location names.
3. Formatted data types — converted dates properly and set revenue/profit columns to currency format.
4. Created new columns such as Month, Weekday, and Revenue for deeper analysis.
5. Removed duplicates and outliers to maintain accuracy and reliability.
6. Organized data into Excel tables with dynamic ranges for easy updates and dashboard integration.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring coffee shop sales data to answer key questions,such as :
- Which locations generated the highest and lowest sales revenue?
- What are the best-selling products and which ones perform poorly?
- How do sales trends vary across months, days, and seasons?
- What is the profitability distribution across different locations and product categories?
- How do customer preferences shift over time or by location?
- Are there any patterns or correlations between product type, sales time, and revenue?


### Data Analysis

The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel using a combination of formulas, pivot tables, and interactive charts to uncover trends and patterns in the coffee shop sales data.
Key analytical approaches included:

- Descriptive Analysis – summarized total sales, revenue, and profit by product, month, and location using pivot tables.
- Comparative Analysis – compared sales performance across different store locations to identify top and underperforming branches.
- Trend Analysis – visualized monthly and daily sales trends to detect seasonality and peak business periods.
- Profitability Analysis – calculated total profit, cost, and margin percentages to assess which locations and products drive the most returns.
- Category Analysis – examined how coffee, tea, bakery items, and merchandise contribute to overall revenue.
- Time-Based Analysis – analyzed sales by time of day to understand customer buying behavior and busiest hours.


### Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights about the coffee shop’s sales performance and profitability:
1. Top-Performing Location: Hell’s Kitchen generated the highest overall revenue, driven by high customer traffic and consistent daily sales.
2. Emerging Location: Astoria showed steady month-over-month growth, indicating potential for expansion or increased marketing investment.
3. Peak Sales Period: June recorded the highest total sales, highlighting a strong seasonal demand for coffee products in summer months.
4. Product Performance: Coffee was the best-selling product category across all stores, followed by tea and bakery items.
5. Profitability Insights: Locations with higher product diversity tended to maintain better profit margins.
6. Customer Behavior: Morning hours showed the highest transaction volume, suggesting that most purchases occurred before work hours.
7. Underperforming Area: Lower Manhattan recorded the lowest evening sales, indicating potential to optimize hours or target new customer segments.


### Recommendations

Based on the insights from the analysis, the following recommendations can help the coffee shop chain improve performance, maximize profits, and enhance customer satisfaction:

- Optimize Operating Hours:
  - Extend opening hours in high-performing locations like Hell’s Kitchen to maximize peak morning traffic.
  - Reduce late evening hours in low-performing areas such as Lower Manhattan to cut operational costs.

- Invest in High-Growth Locations:
  - Increase marketing campaigns or loyalty programs in Astoria, which shows steady sales growth.
  - Consider introducing premium product lines or local promotions to strengthen customer retention there.

- Enhance Product Strategy:
  - Focus on coffee and bakery items as primary revenue drivers.
  - Introduce limited-time seasonal drinks during high-demand months like June to capitalize on trends.

- Improve Inventory and Supply Planning:
  - Use seasonal trends to forecast inventory needs, reducing waste and stockouts.
  - Align supply schedules with daily peak hours to meet demand efficiently.

- Personalize Customer Experience:
  - Offer targeted discounts or loyalty rewards during off-peak hours to balance sales flow.
  - Encourage digital ordering and pick-up options to cater to busy morning customers.

- Expand Data Tracking:

  - Implement digital data tracking or customer feedback tools to gather real-time insights.
  - Continue monitoring sales trends monthly to evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.


  ### Limitations

This analysis was limited by the dataset’s scope and available tools. The data covered only a specific time period and lacked customer demographics, restricting deeper behavioral insights. Since the project was conducted entirely in Excel, advanced analytics and automation were limited compared to tools like Python or Power BI. During data cleaning, extra zeros in the revenue column were removed to ensure accurate financial calculations, though minor assumptions made while handling missing or inconsistent entries may slightly affect precision. Despite these constraints, the project effectively revealed valuable insights into sales, profitability, and seasonal trends.
